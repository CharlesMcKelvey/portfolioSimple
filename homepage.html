        <p>Little Sales Pitch</p>
        <div class="elevator-pitch">I’m a team-oriented, challenge driven software developer. Projects that provide a topic I
            haven’t learned before or have
            but require a new approach are always exciting. If in a team, I practice instilling a firm line of communication
            while
            getting everyone’s views and input for different ways to tackle the task. Gaining perspective while establishing a
            more
            efficient team environment.</div>

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <div class="about-column-divide">
            <div class="about-info">By profession, I strive to be a Full Stack Developer with an ambition towards truly being Full Stack, building full fledged apps solo and asking for help as needed. <br><br>When I am at home, I try my best to be there for my friends and family when they need me to be and help those around me, both in their mental well-being and physically by contributing to the community. Hands for Habitat and Brushes with Kindess gave me a look into the real world and how lucky some of us got it and I try to give back because some of us can't.
            <br><br>Through these actions, we've helped a multitude of individuals that otherwise didn't have the funds, whether it be
            because of medical expenses, inability to work, or otherwise, we made the impact and that has set in me an idea of what
            I want to do with my career.</div>
            <div class="about-info">Development for me started at a young age. I have been a problem solver since I was 5 years old. I enjoy a challenge and I love learning something new. When asked to do a task on the construction site, I usually was the kid willing to jump onto the roof or use the circular saw on a strange cut. This is showcased in my technical aptitude as well. I willingly put myself into situations that others may deem uncomfortable. I've taught myself for the past 4 years, starting on CodeSchool (now known as <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</a>) for a year, then 2 years of <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> and then through MITx, hosted on edX, I acquired a certification in an introductory course to Computer Science. This solidified thoughts on the importance of verbose and documented code, something that I've heard from professionals can be lacking. Six months prior to this, I had heard of a program called Momentum Learning so I began saving up to go to this boot camp. There I learned how to program using Django and further solidifying my Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. </div>
